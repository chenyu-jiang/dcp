## DCP

DCP is a context parallel training library designed for dynamic model input lengths and attention masks.
It introduces fine-grained blockwise partitioning of both data and computation, enables flexible mapping of data and computation blocks to any device and optimizes such mapping through a hyper-graph partitioning framework.
